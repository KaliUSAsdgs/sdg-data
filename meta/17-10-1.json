The unit of measurement will be in % terms. All calculations are based on official data. However, in order to include all tariffs into the calculation, some rates which are not expressed in ad valorem form (e.g., specific duties) are converted in ad valorem equivalents (i.e. in per cent of the import value), The conversion is made at the tariff line level for each importer by using the unit value method. Import unit values are calculated from import values and quantities. Only a limited number of non-ad valorem tariff rates (i.e. technical duties) cannot be provided with ad valorem equivalents (AVE) and are excluded from the calculation. This methodology also allows for cross-country comparisons.","indicator_name":"Worldwide weighted tariff-average","indicator_variable":null,"layout":"indicator","permalink":"/17-10-1/","published":true,"rationale_interpretation":"The average level of customs tariff rates applied worldwide can be used as an indicator of the degree of success achieved by multilateral negotiations.","reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":17,"source_notes":null,"source_title":null,"target":"Promote a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system under the World Trade Organization, including through the conclusion of negotiations under its Doha Development Agenda.","target_id":"17.1","title":"Worldwide weighted tariff-average","un_custodial_agency":"WTO, ITC, UNCTAD","un_designated_tier":"1","variable_description":null,"variable_notes":null,"page_content":""}
