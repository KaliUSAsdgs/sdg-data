rationale_interpretation: "While it is recognized that this indicator captures only\
  \ one of the gravest forms of violence against children rather than being inclusive\
  \ of all forms, it can be considered a proxy indicator that reflects a key aspect\
  \ of the change we want to observe in order to achieve the target of elimination\
  \ of VAC. \nThe right of children to protection from all forms of violence is enshrined\
  \ in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols. 'Sexual\
  \ violence' as defined in General Comment No. 13 on the Convention of the Rights\
  \ of the Child, accessible here: http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/CRC.C.GC.13_en.pdf"
