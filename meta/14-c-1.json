ILO conventions are legally binding international treaties drawn up by the ILO's constituents (governments, employers and workers) and setting out basic principles and rights at work. The ILO Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) is a single, coherent instrument embodying as far as possible all up-to-date standards of existing international maritime labour conventions and recommendations, as well as the fundamental principles to be found in other international labour conventions.","indicator_name":"Number of countries making progress in ratifying, accepting and implementing through legal, policy and institutional frameworks, ocean-related instruments that implement international law, as reflected in the United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea, for the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and their resources","indicator_variable":"national_legal_framework_oceans","layout":"indicator","permalink":"/14-c-1/","published":true,"rationale_interpretation":"This comprehensive convention sets out in one place seafarers' rights to decent conditions of work on almost every aspect of their working and living conditions including, among others, minimum age, employment agreements, hours of work or rest, payment of wages, paid annual leave, repatriation at the end of contract, onboard medical care, the use of licensed private recruitment and placement services, accommodation, food and catering, health and safety protection and accident prevention and seafarers' complaint handling. It represents an essential step toward ensuring fair competition and a level-playing field for quality owners of ships flying the flags of ratifying countries. Given that these international legal measures are aimed at improving working and living conditions for seafarers, the most globalized of the world's workers, the number of countries that have ratified the ILO Maritime Labour Convention gives an indication of the situation of maritime workers around the world.","reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":14,"source_notes":null,"source_title":null,"target":"Enhance the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources by implementing law as reflected in United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea, which provides the legal framework for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans and their resources, as recalled in paragraph 158 of \"The future we want\"","target_id":"14.c","title":"Number of countries making progress in ratifying, accepting and implementing through legal, policy and institutional frameworks, ocean-related instruments that implement international law, as reflected in the United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea, for the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and their resources","un_custodial_agency":"UN DOALOS, FAO, UNEP, ILO, other UN-Oceans agencies","un_designated_tier":"3","variable_description":null,"variable_notes":null,"national_data_update_url_text":"2018-06-09: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/brockfanning/sdg-data/commit/41a111a340f581914929f080013d2ad3c4a7aa0c","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2018-06-10: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/brockfanning/sdg-data/commit/93eb34a70d241fddc61131a36a06b8e85aeb01a1","page_content":""}
